# Brain Tumor Classification: Project Overview 
- Created a Convolutional Neural Network model to classify if a patient has Brain Tumor or not from Brain MRI scans. 
- Downloaded the MRI dataset on Kaggle.
- Made use of Transfer learning to compensate for the dataset size and Data Augmentation to allow the model to generalise better. 
- ImageNet dataset and VGG-16 architecture was utilized for transfer learning via fine-tuning.
- Six Statistical metrics was used to evaluate model performance.
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Macro-average and Weighted-average. 
- Built an application to automate the process of Brain Tumor classification.

## Filter and Feature (Hot Colormap)
- A hot colormap was applied, a sequential black-red-yellow-white, to emulate blackbody radiation from an object at increasing temperatures
- This was to illustrate prominent features in brain MRI scans learned by the Neural Network
